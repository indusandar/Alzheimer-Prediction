# Alzheimer-Prediction

Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia that slowly destroys memory and other mental functions.  5.5 million Americans over the age 65 are reported to have alzheimer’s.  Alzheimer’s disease is ranked as the number 6 cause of death in America, but more recent estimates say it may be higher.        

**Objective:**
Dementia is a generic term for a decrease in mental ability and an overall term that defines a group of symptoms associated with a deterioration in memory or thinking skills severe sufficient to decrease a person’s ability to complete daily tasks.
Diagnosis of dementia
Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other kinds of dementia based on a thorough medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function, and behavior associated with each class. However, it’s harder to discover the exact type of dementia because the signs and brain changes of various dementias can overlap.
